GENERAL:
 - In 1.14+, light sources cannot be placed directly adjacent to other light sources anymore (#15)
    - allowing this would result in buggy behaviour
 - Other bugfixes (#16)

COMMANDS:
 - Refactored Commands internally
 - Removed command book
 - Added /varlight fill: Allows editing large regions (#12)
 - Better tab completion for most commands

PERMISSIONS:
 - Permissions have been refactored
 - /varlight autosave: Still requires permission node "varlight.admin.save"
 - /varlight debug: required permission node changed from "varlight.debug" to "varlight.admin.debug"
 - /varlight migrate: required permission node changed from "varlight.admin" to "varlight.admin.migrate"
